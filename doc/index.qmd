title: A Grammar of Graphics for Python
---

![](images/logo-540.png){.float-end .w-25}

plotnine is an implementation of a *grammar of graphics* in Python
based on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org). The grammar allows you to compose plots by explicitly
mapping variables in a dataframe to the visual objects that make up the plot.

Plotting with a *grammar of graphics* is powerful. Custom (and otherwise
complex) plots are easy to think about and build incremently, while
the simple plots remain simple to create.

## Example

```python
from plotnine import ggplot, geom_point, aes, stat_smooth, facet_wrap
from plotnine.data import mtcars

(
    ggplot(mtcars, aes("wt", "mpg", color="factor(gear)"))
    + geom_point()
    + stat_smooth(method="lm")
    + facet_wrap("gear")
)
```

## Installation

plotnine can be can be installed in a couple of ways, depending on purpose.

### Installing the Official Release
For a normal user, it is recommended to install the official release. You
can choose one these two commands:

```bash
# Using pip
$ pip install plotnine         # 1. should be sufficient for most
$ pip install 'plotnine[all]'  # 2. includes extra/optional packages

# Or using conda
$ conda install -c conda-forge plotnine
```

The second pip command also installs packages that are required for some
specific functionality that may not be frequently used. Those packages
are:

- [scikit-misc](https://has2k1.github.io/scikit-misc/) - For loess smoothing
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.com) - For Gaussian process smoothing

### Installing the Development Version
To do any development you have to clone the
[Plotnine source repository](https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine) and install
the package in development mode. These commands do all of that:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine.git
$ cd plotnine
$ pip install -e .
```

If you only want to use the latest development sources and do not
care about having a cloned repository, e.g. if a bug you care about
has been fixed but an official release has not come out yet, then
use this command:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/has2k1/plotnine.git
```
